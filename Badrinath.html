HISTORY OF BADRINATH
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
Badrinath is considered one of the most holy places
 in Hindu religion. One of the 108 Divya Desams, Badrinath 
temple is part of both Char Dham and Chota Char Dham. Adi 
Shankaracharya found the idol of Lord Badri in Alaknanda River 
and put it up in a cave near the Tapt Kund. In 16th century, a 
Garhwal King got the temple erected, which has been renovated many
 times as a result of natural calamities.
 Sandwiched between Nar and Narayan peaks, the beauty of Badrinath
 Dham is further enhanced with the glorious background of Neelkanth peak.

LEGEND
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
As per one of the legends, the indulgent lifestyle of Lord Vishnu was
criticised by a sage, after which Vishnu went to meditate as an act of 
penance, over here. Goddess Laxmi (his wife) became a berry tree to shade
him from the sun and other harsh elements of nature. Another divine tale 
states that Badrinath used to be the realm of Shiva. Vishnu tricked Shiva 
into leaving the site and established himself instead.
