HISTORY OF YAMUNOTRI
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
Yamunotri is where the second most holy of river of India, the River Yamuna, takes birth. 
Situated in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, Yamunotri Dham is the 
first stop in the pilgrimage. It is believed that bathing in its water 
cleanses all sins and protects from untimely and painful death. The shrine 
of Yamunotri is believed to be built in 1839 by the king of Tehri, Naresh
 Sudarshan Shah. Besides the Yamuna Devi (goddess), the idol of Ganga Devi 
too is housed in the revered temple. There are many hot water springs near
 the temple; Surya Kund is the most important among them. Devotees boil 
rice and potatoes in the kund and accept it as a Prasad of the devi.

LEGEND
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
Yamuna Goddess is believed to be Sun's daughter and twin sister of
 Yama (the god of death). It is said that sage Asit Muni lived here and 
bathed in both Ganga and Yamuna. In his old age, when he was unable to go 
to Gangotri, a stream of Ganga started to flow across the steam of Yamuna.

<b><strong><i>
FOLK TALE BEHIND YAMUNOTRI
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
According to mythological beliefs, there was once the ashram of Asit Rishi.
 He used to visit the Yamuna regularly till the origin of Yamuna.

When he became incapacitated in old age, it became impossible for him
 to reach the source of Yamuna. Impressed by the faith of Asit Rishi towards himself,
 Yamuna changed its flow and started flowing near his ashram.

Pleased with the grace of Yamuna, the sage built his temple there and started 
worshiping Goddess Yamuna. That holy place was called Yamunotri and became the 
main pilgrimage of Goddess Yamuna.
