Char Dham, literally ‘the four abodes’, yatra
 refers to the journey up the mountains to four sacred
 temples in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is also 
referred to as 'Chhota Char Dham' to differentiate it from the bigger
 circuit of Char Dham sites. The four temples that comprise Char Dham are
 Yamunotri Dham, Gangotri Dham, Badrinath Dham and Kedarnath Dham.
Yamunotri Dham, named after the Goddess Yamuna, is the first
 Dham en route the yatra. A bath in the holy waters of Yamuna river 
is said to cleanse one of all sins and protect from untimely death. 
Gangotri Dham, the second temple that falls on the Chota Char Dham 
circuit, is the birthplace of the holy river Ganga. Kedarnath, known 
as the land of Lord Shiva, has the highest located jyotirling. Situated 
on the banks of Mandakini River, the view of this temple against its 
snowy backdrop is resplendent. Badrinath, named after Lord Badri(Vishnu),
 is located along the banks of Alaknanda River. Also part of the bigger 
Char Dham circuit, it stands beautifully on Garhwal Hill, rearing
 its golden head and fluttering its red flags with Godly presence.
