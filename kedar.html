HISTORY OF KEDARNATH
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
Situated in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand,
 Kedarnath is the most remote pilgrimage spot in the yatra. 
It is believed that originally the temple of Kedarnath was built
 by Pandavas. And Adi Shankaracharya got the present structure 
constructed in the 8th century adjacent to the old temple site. 
The grey stone structure is an architectural marvel because of its
 imposing design and its ability to survive for so many centuries in 
such a harsh terrain.

LEGEND
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
Pandavas were searching for Lord Shiva to absolve themselves
 from their sins committed at the battlefield of Mahabharata. Lord
 Shiva was in no mood to forgive them so easily, so he converted
 himself into a bull and went to Garhwal side of Uttarakhand. On being 
found by the Pandavas, he dived into the ground. Different parts of the 
Lord came up at different parts - hump at Kedarnath, arms at Tunganath, 
navel at Madhya-Maheshwar, face at Rudranath and hair emerged at Kalpeshwar. 
Taken together, these five sites are known as Panch-kedar. 
Pandavas got temples made at each of the five places.

POPULAR FACT ABOUT KEDARNATH
</b></strong></i>
&nbsp; <br>
The temple is protected and indestructible:
In the 2013 devastating cloudburst, a massive calamity struck Uttarakhand. 
While the state's mountainous region suffered devastating landslides and floods,
 the temple was saved even despite a huge boulder coming down the mountain. Strangely, 
as it came down the mountain, the huge loose, rolling boulder stopped short a few metres 
away from the temple and in fact shielded it from any destruction even in that calamity. Footages reveal 
that a big rock behind the temple diverted the massive floods of water coming towards the shrine.
